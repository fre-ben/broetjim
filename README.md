# Broetjim

Webpage displaying a special recipe for tasty buns. Calculates the amount of ingredients automatically.

Built for my father as a little "weekend" project, so he does not need to calculate the amount of every single ingredient by himself.

## Technical stuff

Built with React + Vite + Tailwind (DaisyUI as Tailwind component library).

Might move this to Astro at some point for easier static site generation.

### Commands

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Run the development server with:

```bash

```

Build the application with:

```
